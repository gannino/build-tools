# build-tools

## [CRUD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Create,_read,_update_and_delete) for [Gitlab](https://about.gitlab.com/) on [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/) [Â¹](#documentation)

This repo has [Ansible roles](http://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/playbooks_reuse_roles.html) and
[Terraform modules](https://www.terraform.io/docs/modules/usage.html) to set up a cluster running
[Gitlab CI](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/) and supporting services.

The setup and maintenance tasks are broken down into stages (`cluster`, `server`, `service`) and
verbs (`create`, `ready` to validate, `update`, and eventually `delete`).

|         | Create |  Ready | Update |  Delete |
| ------- | ------ | ------ | ------ | ------- |
| Cluster |     âœ… |    ðŸš«  |     âœ… |     âš  |
|  Server |     âœ… |    ðŸš«  |     âœ… |     âš  |
| Service |     âœ… |    ðŸš«  |     âœ… |     âš  |

**WIP:** this project works for me and I'd like to share, but may not work for you. Maybe not at all.
Please open issues if you see anything, or just with questions or suggestions.

To get started, the docs directory has guides for:

- [Setup](docs/setup.md)
- [Maintenance](docs/maintenance.md)
- [Development](docs/development.md)

## What

This playbook sets up a kubernetes cluster in AWS, using kops, to run Gitlab and supporting tools.

Gitlab runners are set up with an autoscaling group of [spot instances](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/spot/), which
automatically shut down after 10 minutes idle and cost about 25% as much as on-demand instances.

Additional clusters can be included and the playbook is able to load context from kubeadm and kops.

Most of the tasks are system-independent and only require `make` and the tools used by the stage, but the
dependencies stage requires Ubuntu 16.04 or better. The latest Ubuntu LTS AMI is used for the kops nodes.

### Cluster Tools

The following tools will be set up within the cluster:

- [Gitlab](https://about.gitlab.com/) (version control and CI)
- [Gitlab runners](https://docs.gitlab.com/runner/) (AWS spot instances and optionally dedicated servers)

Using the AWS services:

- [EC2](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/) (on-demand, reserved, and/or spot instances)
- [ElastiCache](https://aws.amazon.com/elasticache/) (redis)
- [RDS](https://aws.amazon.com/rds/) (postgresql)
- [Route53](https://aws.amazon.com/route53/) (DNS)

With support from the SaaS tools:

- [Foxpass](https://www.foxpass.com/) (authentication/authorization)
- [Grafana](https://grafana.com/) (graphing)
- [Keybase](https://keybase.io/) (identity verification)
- [Papertrail](https://papertrailapp.com/) (logging)
- [Sentry](https://sentry.io/) (error logging)
- [UptimeRobot](https://uptimerobot.com/) (availability monitoring)

## How

make is used as a task runner, orchestrating the ansible playbook runs using tags. In short:

1. you provide a config with DNS zone, VPC, and secrets
1. a kubernetes cluster definition is rendered from the secrets into a terraform module.
1. terraform runs to set up the cache, database, and kubernetes nodes.
1. kubernetes service definitions are rendered from the secrets, config, and templates.

### Local Tools

The following tools are used locally to set up the cluster:

- [ansible](https://www.ansible.com/) v2.4
- [aws](https://aws.amazon.com/cli/)
- [bash](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/) v4
- [blackbox](https://github.com/StackExchange/blackbox)
- [kops](https://github.com/kubernetes/kops) v1.8.2 (git-0ab8b57c2 or later)
- [kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/kubectl/overview/)
- [make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/)
- [terraform](https://www.terraform.io/) v0.11.2

Some of these should be installed before running, some can be installed by the Ansible playbook. Please see
[the setup guide Â§ dependencies](docs/setup.md#dependencies) for details.

The version requirements are noted when a very recent version is needed, usually for a specific fix. Otherwise,
most recent versions should work.

## Where

The resources created by this project will be in [Amazon AWS](https://aws.amazon.com).

You may provide your own kubernetes clusters (provisioned with kops or kubeadm) and allocate some services there,
although the core services (Gitlab, DNS, and autoscaling) are only supported in AWS clusters.

**TODO:** provide a way to disable the kops cluster

## Why

This repo shows a way to automate build infrastructure and projects within it, using common open-source tools. This
setup scales well from small, personal projects to company clusters.
